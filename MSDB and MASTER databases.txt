 MSDB 
 The msdb database contains SQL jobs, backup jobs, schedules, operators, and backup and restore 
 histories and can contain Integration Services packages and other items. If you create a new job or 
 add a new Integration Services package and msdb were to fail, the previous backup would not contain 
 these new jobs and would need to be recreated.  
 
 MASTER 
 The master database contains the login information: metadata about each database for the SQL 
 instance. Moreover, it contains SQL Server conﬁ guration information. For example, the database is 
 altered every time you do the following: Add, remove, or modify a database level setting. Add or delete 
 a user database. Add or remove a ﬁ le or ﬁ legroup in a user database. Add, remove, or modify a 
 login`s security. Modify a SQL Server serverwide conﬁ guration. Add or remove a logical backup device. 
 Conﬁ gure distributed queries or remote procedure calls (RPC). Add, modify, or remove a linked server 
 or remote login. Although these modiﬁ cations occur infrequently, when they do, consider doing 
 a full database backup. If a backup is not performed, you stand to lose the modiﬁ cations if a previous 
 backup of the master is restored. Moreover, as a precautionary measure, before and after adding 
 any service pack or hotﬁ x, perform a new backup of the master databas
