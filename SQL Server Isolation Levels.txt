Dirty Reads – This is when you read uncommitted data, when doing this there is no guarantee that data 
 read will ever be committed meaning the data could well be bad. 

Phantom Reads – This is when data that you are working with has been changed by another transaction
since you first read it in. This  means subsequent reads of this data in the same transaction could well be different.
