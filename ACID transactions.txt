ACID transactions: atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable

ATOMIOCITY requires that each transaction is "all or nothing": if one part of the transaction fails, 
the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee 
atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors, and crashes. To the outside world, 
a committed transaction appears (by its effects on the database) to be indivisible ("atomic"),
 and an aborted transaction does not happen.

The CONSSISTENCY property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. 
Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including but not limited to
 constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This does not guarantee correctness 
of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code) 
but merely that any programming errors do not violate any defined rules.

The ISOLATION property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state 
that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially, i.e. one after the other.
 Providing isolation is the main goal of concurrency control. Depending on concurrency control method, 
the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to another transaction.

DURABILITY means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss,
 crashes, or errors. In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute,
 the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes immediately thereafter). 
To defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be recorded in a non-volatile memory.
